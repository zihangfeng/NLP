# NLP
EGrader

We use Java 8 to run the program. User can use eclipse to run the program, or create an executable file for windows or linux environment platform whichever one the user prefers. We already compiled our system, so there is no need for the user to train again. However, if user does not want to train, the training files Must leave empty in order for the system not to get the training files. Do not delete the folder names of the high, medium, and low, because the system will read them. If they do not exist, it will cost compiler error. Just do not contain the text files in the training folders. If the user wants to get the training part, the high, medium, and low folders in the training part, canâ€™t be empty, because that does not make sense to train one class but not the others. We choose to use tokenized version to do the training or testing, please fill the files within the correspoding field for the training. We slightly change the formula provided from the instruction of the project, because we thought that could improve the prediction of the testing files. The new formula looks almost the same as the original one with one more variable 3b.
